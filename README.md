# Persons List Project<br>

This project involves a simple implementation in Python and a corresponding HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend to process and display information about persons.
<br><br>
## Project Structure<br>

The project consists of the following files:<br>

- `python_script.py`: Python script to prepare and process data.<br>
- `index.html`: HTML file for displaying the results.<br>
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML content.<br>
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for dynamic content manipulation.<br>
- `README.md`: Documentation file.<br><br>

## Python Script<br>

The Python script (`python_script.py`) performs the following tasks:<br>

1. Data Preparation: Creates a list of dictionaries representing persons with attributes such as name, age, and city.<br>
2. Filtering: Filters out persons under the age of 25.<br>
3. Sorting: Sorts the remaining persons based on their city.<br>
4. Output: Prints the final list of persons to the console.<br>
<br>
## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br>

- `index.html`: Contains a simple structure to display the results.<br>
- `styles.css`: Provides styling rules for a clean and visually appealing layout.<br>
- `script.js`: Dynamically updates the HTML content when the page is loaded.<br>
<br>
## Styling<br>

The styling includes a clean and modern look, with a focus on readability and user interaction.<br><br>

## How to Run<br>

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the results.<br>
2. Optionally, you can run the Python script (`python_script.py`) to see the console output.<br><br>

## Dependencies<br>

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Used for styling components.<br><br>
